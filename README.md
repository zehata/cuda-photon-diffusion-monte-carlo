Originally written on Google Colab to use the (much faster) GPU on the service. This is an extremely basic demonstration of photon diffusion in turbid tissue, it's just to show my teammates how to apply equations being taught in class.

#### Why CUDA?

Because I had no other GPUs to test on

#### Usage

Tested working on Google Colab T4 sessions as of writing (Aug 2025)

To run this locally you will need:

A supported CUDA-based GPU

python 3 (tested with 3.11)

torch (PyTorch) (tested with 2.6.0)

numpy (tested with 2.0.2)

matplotlib (tested with 3.10.0)
